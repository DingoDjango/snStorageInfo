## **Storage Info by Dingo**

#### **Description:**
In Subnautica, only empty containers relay their status to the player. With this mod containers will always show if they are:  
* Empty  
* Full  
* Have a certain amount of items, but aren't full  

#### **Installation:**
1) Install [QMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/201)﻿ if you haven't already  
2) Install [SMLHelper (Modding Helper)](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/113)  
3) Download the zip file from the [Files tab](https://www.nexusmods.com/subnautica/mods/229/?tab=files)  
4) Unzip the contents of the zip to the game's main directory (where Subnautica.exe can be found)  

#### **(Optional) Translation:**
If you want to contribute a translation for this mod, please follow these steps:  
1) Look at the file *"English.json"* in *QMods\StorageInfo\Languages*  
2) Copy that file and change the file name to your language. It needs to match the file name in *Subnautica\SNUnmanagedData\LanguageFiles*  
3) Translate the file. Do not touch the keys ("ContainerFull"), only the translated values ("completely full")  
4) Share the file with me, preferrably over GitHub, a Nexus private message or (if you must) a comment  

#### **FAQ:**

* **Q. Is this mod safe to add or remove from an existing save file?**  
* A. Perfectly safe.  
* **Q. Does this mod have any known conflicts?**  
* A. No, unless some other mod patches *StorageContainer.OnHandHover* and doesn't play nice.
